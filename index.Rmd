These standard operating procedures and scripts were developed for the Grain Cropping Systems Lab at UC Davis. They are geared towards use in agronomic crops in a research settting. 

## Episodes
1. Multispectral Data Visualization
2. Multispectral Data Extraction

## Requirements

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow.  *These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools*, but
working through this lesson requires working copies of the software described
below.  To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to download
the data and install everything *before* working through this lesson.
