# Drone Data in QGIS for Agricultural Research

![](/img/cover-img.jpg)

This is an example and starting point for multispectral image analysis designed for beginners. The lessons can be taught in approximately 2 hours. They start with importing and visualizing drone based multispectral data in QGIS and move through how to extract data values for areas of interest in both a manual, low throughput method and a more automated, high throughput method.

1. [Multispectral Data Visualization](01-multispectral-data-visualization.md)
2. [Multispectral Data Extraction (Low throughput)](02-multispectral-data-extraction.md)
3. [Multispectral Data Extraction (High throughput)](03-high-throughput-data-extraction.md)

## Requirements

These lessons are meant to be hands-on with users following along on their own computers. Please, download the data and software before starting. QGIS is a cross platform technology but sometimes looks and behaves differently on different operating systems. So please note that these lessons were developed and tested using Windows. 

### Data

Data files for the lessons are available and can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/tnelsen/Drone-Data-in-Agricultural-Research/archive/data.zip">HERE</a>.

### Software

* To install QGIS go to: <a href = "https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html">https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html</a>.
