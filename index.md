title: "Drone Data in QGIS for Agricultural Research"
author: Taylor Nelsen
---

This is an example and starting point for multispectral image analysis designed for beginngers. The lessons can be taught in approximately 2 hours. They start with importing and visualizing drone based multispectral data in QGIS and move through how to extract data values for areas of interest in both a manual, low throughput method and a more automated, high throughput method.


## Topics
1. [Multispectral Data Visualization](01-multispectral-data-visualization.md)
2. [Multispectral Data Extraction](02-multispectral-data-extraction.md)

## Requirements

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow.  *These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools*, but
working through this lesson requires working copies of the software described
below.  To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to download
the data and install everything *before* working through this lesson.
