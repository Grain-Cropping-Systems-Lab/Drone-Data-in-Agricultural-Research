# Drone Data in QGIS for Agricultural Research

![](/img/cover-img.jpg)

This is an example and starting point for multispectral image analysis designed for beginngers. The lessons can be taught in approximately 2 hours. They start with importing and visualizing drone based multispectral data in QGIS and move through how to extract data values for areas of interest in both a manual, low throughput method and a more automated, high throughput method.


## Topics

1. [Multispectral Data Visualization](01-multispectral-data-visualization.md)
2. [Multispectral Data Extraction](02-multispectral-data-extraction.md)

## Requirements

These lessons are meant to be hands-on with users following along on thier own computers. Please, download the data and software before starting. 

### Data

Data files for the lesson are available and can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/tnelsen/Drone-Data-in-Agricultural-Research/archive/data.zip">HERE</a>.
### Software

* Have QGIS installed. These lessons currently use QGIS 3.10.5. See https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html to download and for installation instructions.
